    We have collected user activity data on a food delivery app. Here are the key stats:

    {stats_text}

    User journeys:
    {journeys_text}

    Drop-off points:
    {dropoff_text}

    Please analyze this data from the perspective of the restaurants. For each restaurant mentioned, provide:
    - A short summary of how users interacted with their page and menu
    - Any signs of friction (e.g. users adding items to cart but not checking out, clearing cart, abandoning at checkout)
    - Suggestions for the restaurant to improve conversions (e.g. promotions, clearer menu structure, better item descriptions)
    - Optional: Any app-level UI or flow recommendations that could improve the experience

    Be specific and actionable. Provide insights as if advising the restaurant owner or manager on how to increase orders.
