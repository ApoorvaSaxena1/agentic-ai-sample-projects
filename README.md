ðŸ§  Agentic AI Sample Projects

Welcome to Agentic AI Sample Projects â€” a growing collection of exploratory projects that demonstrate how AI agents can be applied to solve practical problems, generate insights, and assist in decision-making.

Iâ€™m passionate about experimenting with agentic AI patterns and sharing sample projects that showcase how AI tools, automation, and analytics can come together to build intelligent systems.

ðŸš€ Current Projects
ðŸ“Œ User Journey Analyzer Agent
A Python-based tool that simulates, analyzes, and visualizes user journeys in a food delivery app and generates AI-powered recommendations to improve restaurant conversions.

ðŸ‘‰ Highlights:

Synthetic clickstream data generator
Rich data visualizations (sunburst, Sankey, heatmaps, network diagrams)
AI insights generated via OpenAI API

âœ¨ Future Plans
This repository is just getting started!
âœ… I plan to continuously add more sample projects exploring different agentic AI ideas, including:

AI assistants for product analytics
Data-cleaning and enrichment agents
AI-powered report generators
Workflow automation bots

Each project will come with code, documentation, and sample outputs to help others learn, extend, or get inspired.
